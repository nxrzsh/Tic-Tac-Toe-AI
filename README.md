# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe AI repository! This project implements a computer-versus-computer Tic-Tac-Toe game using the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**, ensuring optimal decision-making for an unbeatable AI opponent.  


## **How to Play**  

The game follows the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** rules:  
- Played on a **3x3 grid** where two players take turns marking an empty cell with **X** or **O**.  
- The player who aligns **three marks in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.  
- If the grid is full with no winner, the game ends in a **draw**. 
## Features
In single-player mode: Compete with a computer opponent.
Randomized computer moves: The machine performs calculated, strategic moves that are not insurmountable.
